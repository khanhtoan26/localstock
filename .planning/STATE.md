## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 6-phase pipeline architecture following data dependency chain (Data → Analysis → LLM/Scoring → Reports → Automation → Dashboard)
- [Roadmap]: SCOR-04/SCOR-05 placed in Phase 5 (Automation) — require historical run data for score change detection and sector rotation tracking
- [Roadmap]: MACR-01/MACR-02 placed in Phase 4 (Reports) — macro context enriches AI reports, and macro data is hardest to source so it comes after core pipeline works
- [Phase 01]: BigInteger for StockPrice.volume — Vietnamese stock volumes can exceed 2B
- [Phase 01]: pytest-timeout added as dev dependency for timeout=30 config support

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Research]: Corporate action data sourcing for HOSE needs investigation during Phase 1 planning — CafeF scraping likely but unvalidated
- [Research]: Qwen2.5 Vietnamese financial text performance unverified — may need fallback to 7B or Vistral during Phase 3
- [Research]: vnai dependency in vnstock has caused issues — may need patching if problematic on Linux

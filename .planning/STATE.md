**Core value:** Agent tự động phân tích và xếp hạng cổ phiếu HOSE — cho tôi danh sách gợi ý đáng mua kèm lý do rõ ràng, cập nhật hàng ngày, không tốn phí API.
**Current focus:** v1.5 Performance & Data Quality — Phase 22 Logging Foundation (entry point per A→B→C→D→E→F→G build order)

## Current Position

Phase: 22 — Logging Foundation
Plan: 06 (complete) → Phase 22 complete
Status: 22-06 complete; pre-commit + GHA lint gates active, OBS-06 closed
Last activity: 2026-04-28 — 22-06 complete; OBS-06 enforced via pre-commit + GHA; Phase 22 done

Progress: [██████████] 100%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 53 (v1.0: 23, v1.1: 12, v1.2: 8, v1.3: 14, v1.4: 11)
- Total plans created: 53

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Full decision history from v1.0–v1.4 archived in `.planning/milestones/`.

- Phase 22 Wave 0: RED test scaffolds + OBS-06 lint skeleton landed before any impl (Nyquist contract)
- 22-02: log_level field_validator normalizes to uppercase and rejects non-loguru levels at startup (OBS-01)
- Phase 22 Plan 01: lazy _stdout_sink callable for loguru sink to support pytest capsys per-test stdout swap; preserves serialize/enqueue/diagnose contract
- 22-03: CorrelationIdMiddleware validates inbound X-Request-ID against ^[A-Za-z0-9-]{8,64}$ and uses logger.contextualize for loguru extras (D-02/D-04)
- 22-05: f-string log sweep used `logger.exception()` inside every except block — auto-captures traceback through redacted JSON sink instead of f-string interpolating exception value

### Watch Out For (from research)

Top pitfalls from `.planning/research/PITFALLS.md` to keep front-of-mind through v1.5:

- Pitfall 4 — f-string log lines defeat structured logging (Phase 22 CI gate)
- Pitfall 5 — loguru double-init / Prometheus `Duplicated timeseries` in tests (Phase 22, 23)
- Pitfall 6 — label cardinality explosion if `symbol` becomes a label (Phase 23)
- Pitfall 10 — NaN/Inf into JSONB → broken `/api/reports` JSON parse (Phase 25)
- Pitfall 11 — Tier 2 hard-gates abort day-one; require shadow mode (Phase 25)
- Pitfall 1 — TTL-only cache returns stale ranks after pipeline; key must include `pipeline_run_id` (Phase 26)
- Pitfall 8 — vnstock soft-ban on uncapped concurrency; Semaphore(8) + token-bucket (Phase 27)
- Pitfall 9 — DB pool exhaustion at 15:45 if `pool_size` not lifted with concurrency (Phase 27)
- Pitfall 12 — locking index migrations during pipeline window; `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` only, run outside 15:30–16:30 (Phase 28)
- Pitfall 13 — Supabase pgbouncer disables `pg_stat_statements` on transaction-pooler URL (Phase 28)

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns
